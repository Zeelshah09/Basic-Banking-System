                A GRIP Bank is a financial institution which performs the deposit and lending function. A bank allows a person with
                excess money (Saver) to deposit his money in the bank and earns an interest rate. Similarly, the bank lends
                 to a person who needs money (investor/borrower) at an interest rate.
                 The bank usually takes a deposit from the public at a much lower rate called deposit rate and lends the money 
                 to the borrower at a higher interest rate called lending rate.

                Dealing with such entities, organizing it in the right categories and maintaining the records aren't the
                simple thing and many schools find it really hard. So, to deal with anything related to libraries, the
                school library management system is an ideal choice since it includes all features in a single package.
                Major benefits of using this system to manage the libraries include following:
